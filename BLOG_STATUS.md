# Blog Status

## Current Status: Placeholder Page

The blog section is currently showing a "Coming Soon" placeholder page while waiting for client content.

### What's Active

- ✅ **Blog Page** (`/blog`) - Shows a beautiful "Coming Soon" message with information about what to expect
- ✅ **Navigation** - Blog link is active in header and footer
- ✅ **SEO Metadata** - Page has proper meta tags for search engines

### What's Disabled (Temporarily)

- ❌ **GitHub Integration** - Blog API routes removed
- ❌ **Dynamic Post Pages** - Individual blog post routes disabled
- ❌ **Markdown Processing** - Not needed until content is ready

### When Client is Ready to Add Content

To re-enable the full blog system with GitHub integration:

1. **Uncomment/Restore Blog Infrastructure:**
   - The blog infrastructure code is preserved in `/lib/` folder
   - `blog-config.ts` - GitHub repository configuration
   - `github-api.ts` - API functions to fetch posts
   - `markdown.ts` - Markdown processing utilities

2. **Restore API Routes:**
   - Create `/app/api/blog/route.ts`
   - Create `/app/api/blog/[slug]/route.ts`
   - (Reference: `BLOG_SETUP_GUIDE.md` has the code)

3. **Restore Dynamic Pages:**
   - Create `/app/(default)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - (Reference: Git history has the previous version)

4. **Update Blog Listing:**
   - Replace placeholder in `/app/(default)/blog/page.tsx`
   - Add back the GitHub fetching logic
   - (Reference: Git history has the previous version)

5. **Client Setup:**
   - Client creates GitHub repository
   - Updates configuration in `/lib/blog-config.ts`
   - Adds markdown files to repository
   - Blog posts appear automatically

### Quick Reference Files

All blog infrastructure is documented in:
- `/BLOG_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions
- `/sample-blog-post.md` - Example markdown format
- Git commit: `5406db1` - Last commit before simplification

### Current Page Content

The placeholder shows:
- Hero section explaining blog is coming soon
- List of what visitors can expect (tips, stories, insights)
- Professional and on-brand design
- Orange theme color integration

**Note:** The blog infrastructure is NOT deleted, just disabled. Everything can be re-enabled quickly when content is ready.
